                    2 to 1 is a two player game.
                    Each player picks either yes or no.
                    If one player picked yes and the other picked no,
                    the player that picked yes gets 2 points
                    and the player who picked no gets 1 point.
                    If both players picked the same thing, no one gets any points.
                    This is repeated for a certain number of rounds.
                    Both players try to get as many points as they can.
